# Yaskawa ROS1

## Description
This repo allows you to communicate and control the SIA5F Yaskawa robot on ROS1 noetic. Currently, the support for the FS100 controller on ROS2 is not available (refers to [official repo](https://github.com/Yaskawa-Global/motoros2)).
If you want to use them with ROS2 you can use a ros bridge as proposed below.
